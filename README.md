Experiment with feature selection algorithms for sketched character recognition.

This project implements different feature extraction algorithms. This includes algorithms from existing literature and will include self developed algorithms.

Currently developed features:
-----------------------------

1. Cosine Transform
2. Dark Level Zoning
3. Angle Count Zoning
4. Transform-Invariant Geometric Moments
